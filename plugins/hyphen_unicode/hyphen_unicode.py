PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION = '''Replaces unicode character HYPHEN (U+2010) [0xE2 0x80
0x90] with typographically identical HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D) [0x2D] for fonts
that do not support HYPHEN and to prevent visually duplicate filenames
differentiated only by their hyphens.

Unicode duplicated hyphen from ASCII as an unambiguous way to designate a
hyphen from a minus whilst still being typographically indentical. Since
text processing on music tags is rare so choice is purely pedantic esepcially
as keyboards only have HYPHEN-MINUS.

Replaces character on "album", "title", "artist", "artists", "artistsort",
"albumartist", "albumartists" and "albumartistsort" tags.'''
