PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION = '''Tries to determine all artists, and store them in a way that other tools can read (by separating artists with a semicolon).

This can be used as part of your first pass over new files, but **double-check the results before saving them.** This plugin has to guess what is and isn't an artist's name, and because of that may mangle some values.

Retrieves artist names from:
- Existing `artist` / `artists` tags.
- **ft. SomeArtist** or **feat. SomeArtist** in the title.
- **(SomeArtist cover)** or **(SomeArtist remix)** in the title.

Artist names are split on commas, **`&`**, and the text **"and"**. We also depend on whitespace existing around the separators for safety. Basically we try to split artists from each other (hopefully) without running into too many cases where we unintentionally split a single artist's name into two.

We also ignore artist names like 'acoustic', 'bass boosted', etc. Just in case someone e.g. has **(acoustic cover)** in the title.

Future improvements:
- Split on semicolons as well, to catch cases where artist tag already has split names in it?
- Split by "ft." etc in the artist field as well, because some people put this info into the artist field.
- Match "featuring SomeArtist" as well.
- Match multiple types of brackets. Some people like square brackets!
- Handle artist names that contain semicolons a bit better (can we escape these?).
- Maybe have a popup so users can choose which matchers to allow/not when determining the artists, to allow for different title setups.
- Confirm how we handle titles with multiple matchers, and/or when spaces are missing (e.g. **"Coolest Song Ever (feat.Artist1 + Artist2) (Artist3 Remix)"**
